# Better Replays
An OBS Lua script to improve replays.

## Features
- Saves replays to subfolders based on the game being played
- Plays a sound notification when a replay is saved
- Restarts the replay buffer when a replay is saved (this prevents overlapped replays)

## Installation

2. Create a folder somewhere on your PC and extract the `Better Replays.zip` file you downloaded
3. In OBS, go to `Tools > Scripts`, click the `+`, and locate `BetterReplays.lua` from the folder you created
